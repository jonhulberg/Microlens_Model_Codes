# Microlens Resources

This repository hosts community-editable resources summarizing microlens modeling and simulation codes. 
The value of this repository is that it is completely outside any specific project (e.g. Roman, Rubin), 
community editable, and can be continuously updated.

* Table of Model Types Supported by Each Package
